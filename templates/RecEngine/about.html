               Have you ever been on an online streaming platform like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Voot? I watched a movie and after some time, that platform started recommending me different movies and TV shows. I wondered, how the movie streaming platform could suggest me content that appealed to me. Then I came across something known as Recommendation System. This system is capable of learning my watching patterns and providing me with relevant suggestions. Having witnessed the fourth industrial revolution where Artificial Intelligence and other technologies are dominating the market, I am sure that you must have come across a recommendation system in your everyday life. I am also sure that by this time curiosity must be getting the best of you.

                    A recommendation system also finds a similarity between the different products. For example, Netflix Recommendation System provides you with the recommendations of the movies that are similar to the ones that have been watched in the past. Furthermore, there is a collaborative content filtering that provides you with the recommendations in respect with the other users who might have a similar viewing history or preferences. There are two types of recommendation systems – Content-Based Recommendation System and Collaborative Filtering Recommendation. In this project of recommendation system in R, we will work on a collaborative filtering recommendation system and more specifically, ITEM based collaborative recommendation system.

                   <h3>Collaborative Filtering</h3>
                <p>
                    This type of filter is based on users’ rates, and it will recommend us movies that we haven’t watched yet, but users similar to us have, and like. To determine whether two users are similar or not, this filter considers the movies both of them watched and how they rated them. By looking at the items in common, this type of algorithm will basically predict the rate of a movie for a user who hasn’t watched it yet, based on the similar users’ rates.
                     order to work accurately, this type of filter needs rates, and not all users rate products constantly. Some of them barely or never rate anything! Another characteristic of this method is the diversity in the recommendations, that can be good or bad, depending on the case. For example, let’s say user A likes dystopian movies and dark comedy a lot. User B also enjoys dystopian movies but never watched dark comedy. The collaborative filter will recommend dark comedy shows to user B, based on the common taste that the two users have for dystopian movies. This scenario can go two ways: either user B finds out that he/she likes dark comedy a lot, and in that case, great, a lot of new things to watch on his/her list! Or, user B really enjoys a lighter comedy style, and in that case the recommendation has not been successful.

               <h3>Content based Filtering</h3>
               <p>
                   This type of filter does not involve other users if not ourselves. Based on what we like, the algorithm will simply pick items with similar content to recommend us.
                    In this case there will be less diversity in the recommendations, but this will work either the user rates things or not. If we compare this to the example above, maybe user B potentially likes dark comedy but he/she will never know, unless he/she decides to give it a try autonomously, because this filter will only keep recommending dystopian movies or similar. Of course there are many categories we can calculate the similarity on: in the case of movies we can decide to build our own recommender system based on genre only, or maybe we want to include director, main actors and so on.
                    So far I have mentioned many times the word similarity, but what is it, exactly? It doesn’t really seem something we can quantify, but surprisingly it can be measured! Before jumping into a practical example of how to build a content-based system, let’s briefly review the concept of cosine similarity. This is one of the metric that we can use when calculating similarity, between users or contents.
